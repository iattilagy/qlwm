1.1 Fixed compile problem that occured with some gcc versions. 
    Worked around different appearance of a frame style with 
    newer Qt versions.
    Qt 2.2.0 seems to set the name resource to 'unnamed' so that
    window managers fail to identify programs. Worked around by 
    using the class resource instead.

1.2 A change in event processing after Qt 2.0.2 has caused a 
    strange appearance after resizing windows.
    
1.3 Implemented keyboard support

1.4 Possible to disable display of menu and winlist buttons on the toolbar

1.5 Rohit Jalan <rohitj@prakashcotton.com> has done some improvements on the
    keyboard support and added the 'end session' function to the menu.

1.6 Implemented the screenmode (see manpage)    

1.7 Fixes the bug that rowcolumn alignment was incorrect in screenmode.
    
1.8 Restart the WM after change of defaults file.  Don't remove buttons of
    mapped windows after accessing them from the keyboard.

1.9 Bugfix: One application has placed parts at wrong positions on the screen.
    Reason was that a synthetic configure notify was sent to the client only
    after resizing but not after moving.

2.0 Automatically exclude shaped windows from screenmode.
    Allow reference to applications in a name,class format.
    Add check for system mail directory to biff makefile.

2.1 Fixes a bug in mail indicator that was made in 2.0: It didn't work 
    without the mail environment variable anymore.

2.2 Keyboard support was partially broken after upgrading to Qt 2.2.4. There
    was a change in the focus behaviour of menus, perhaps of no interest for
    a normal application but for a window manager that has to deal with xlib
    events.

2.3 Added configurability for Qt style and maximize functions.
    The winlist marks selected windows on the pager.
    Forward color changes to toolbar clients.
    
2.4 Allow user specified configuration directory.
    Implemented screen tiling mode.
    Added flags to exclude specific windows from tiling and screen mode.
    Added hide-window key.
    Added numbering for windows with the same title.

2.5 The wininfo function (middle mouse button on window title) does now
    show a settings screen.
    Restore the size of a tiled maximized window after it was iconified.
    Added appdefaults flag to skip keyboard access.

2.6 Realized menu internals (kill, end) with keywords for better configurability.
    Shaped windows show a resize handle by default.
    Some minor fixes.

3.0 Compiles with Qt3.
    Allow to specify Qt3 style plugins.

3.1 Mail indicator: occasional wrong indication on some platforms. 
    SIGTERM to qlwm killed X session.
    Default links against qt-mt (-thread).
    Install private configuration files with make install-config. 

4.0 Port to Qt4.
    This and that.

4.1 Fix text formatting in winfo
    Fix Makefile related compile issue on some platforms
  
4.2 Fix a memory leak in apbar
    Changes for build system and avoid QTDIR method because this is obsolete in Qt4

4.3 A small fix in the event handler was necessary to avoid some weirdness after 
    upgrading to Qt4.4
    Iconified windows map always on the current desktop now.
    Added a StayOnBottom function.
